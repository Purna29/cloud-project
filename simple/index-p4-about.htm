        <h1>ABOUT BCCI:</h1>
        <h4>INTODUCTION</h4>
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the national governing body
for cricket in India.The board was formed in December 1928 as a society,
registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act. It is a consortium of
state cricket associations and the state associations select their representatives who 
in turn elect the BCCI Chief. Its headquarters are in Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. 
        <h4>HISTORY</h4>
In 1912, an all-India cricket team visited England for the first time, sponsored and captained
by Maharaja of Patiala. In 1926, two representatives of the Calcutta Cricket Club travelled to
London to attend meetings of the Imperial Cricket Conference, the predecessor to the current International
Cricket Council. Although technically not an official representative of Indian cricket, they were 
allowed to attend by Lord Harris, chairman of the conference. The outcome of the meeting was the 
MCC's decision to send a team to India, led by Arthur Gilligan, who had captained England in The 
Ashes.
      <h4>PRESIDENT</h4>
The current president is Sourav Ganguly who is a former captain of Indian cricket team.
